"""
sources.py — comprehensive entry-level + intern cybersec/GRC/risk scraper

SOURCES:
  1. LinkedIn Jobs      — 80 focused searches (max 4 OR terms each)
  2. Google Jobs        — 10 broader searches (different index)
  3. Indeed India       — 12 targeted searches
  4. LinkedIn Posts     — 40 Google RSS queries (hiring posts + intern posts)

NAUKRI: permanently removed — GitHub Actions IPs blocked (HTTP 406 recaptcha).
GLASSDOOR: permanently removed — consistent 403 from GitHub Actions IPs.

FIXES in this version:
  - LinkedIn Posts now filters out login pages, sign-up pages, company pages
  - LinkedIn profile pages filtered by URL (/in/) and title regex
  - Added minimum description length check to drop empty/useless entries
  - Post URLs validated to only keep actual post/pulse/article/feed links
  - Profile regex catches Name - Title @ Company AND Name - Title | Company formats
  - GARBAGE_URL_PATTERNS now includes linkedin.com/in/ as permanent catch-all
